I'm a biomedical researcher by day &mdash; semi-competent rock climber, bike commuter, dog lover, craft beer enthusiast, aspiring home brewer, music fan, amateur musician, and data scientist in-training by night. Ok...I often do a lot of that other stuff during the day too. I work as a Bioinformatician at the [Benaroya Research Institute](https://www.benaroyaresearch.org/) in Seattle, WA. I share an apartment with my girlfriend and our two stellar dogs, and I do my best to make the most of what life in Seattle (and the greater Washington state) has to offer.
