## Rivals!

For year 11 of the **Jefferson Cup** fantasy football league, we've agreed to establish **official rivalries** among pairs of teams. To give some historical context, schedules are randomly generated each year with three consistent features: 

1. you play each of the other 5 teams in your division from week 1 to week 5;  
2. you play the 6 teams in the other division from week 6 to 11; then 
3. your first two matchups are repeated in weeks 11 and 13. 

Because a lot of crap can go down in week 13 &mdash; teams make the playoffs (or not), last place penalties are handed down, etc. &mdash; your opponent that week can have a big influence on the outcome of your season. On top of that, you already played them in week 2, so there's decent likelihood of a grudge. This creates a natural, if entirely unofficial and mostly contrived, rivalry for that season\*.

\*one could argue that the week 1 and 12 matchup could also constitute a rivaly, but that would be dumb.

Going into the current season, team owners were asked to rank their fellow league members from **1st (biggest rival)** to **12th (most benign)**, based on whatever past transgressions, perceived slights, imagined feuds, or whatever other arbitrary criteria they felt was appropriate. I've tallied the responses, and you can read about the results below!

*All of the R code used to tabulate results and generate graphics is available [here]("https://github.com/jaeddy/jaeddy.github.io/tree/master/_source/2016-08-14-rivals-2016-edition.Rmd"), if you're curious.* 



## Who do we hate most? (spoiler: it's Brad)

The first thing I can do is to tally up the rankings for each person. I'll assign a score to each owner, based on the average ranks given by all other owners. Higher score = more people ranked you towards the top of the rival list; lower score = people generally think you're irrelevant. Scores can theoretically range from 0 to 100 (cause maths).

While Matt was a close second, Brad is the winner (?) in terms of overall **"rivaltude"** &mdash; his score of **66.67** corresponds to an average assigned rank of **4.67** out of 12. This should not be a surprise to anyone. Brad's pretty much the worst... In contrast, Milf's score of **32.58** corresponds to an average ranking of **8.42**. Most of the league either really likes Milf, or doesn't feel threatened by him whatsoever.

**NOTE:** These results are slightly biased, because several people decided to be cute and rank themselves as their own biggest rival. For the sake of this particular graph though, that's fine &mdash; if you think you're your own worst enemy, I don't see any reason why that vote shouldn't count.

**OTHER NOTE:** Neither Keith nor Shep provided a response for Drew. These `NA`s might have been intended as the lowest possible rank (i.e., no rivalry whatsoever), which would have lowered Drew's overall score. However, I'm not going to adjust things just because people don't know how to use a survey.

## Quantifying enmnity

Figuring out who we *all* dislike (on average) is interesting, but the real question is who dislikes *each other* most. Each potential rival (i.e., one of the 12 possible survey choices) received a ranking from each of the other 11 owners. In turn, each rival also gave a ranking to each of the other owners. By pairing owners up and looking at their recipricol rankings, we can start to see which couples really belong together.

For example, if Brad ranked Drew 1st, and Drew ranked Brad 1st, the average ranking between them is **1** &mdash; indicating a perfect rival match. If Billy ranked Matt 12th, but Matt ranked Billy 1st... well, for one, it'd be a little awkward, cause there are obviously some mixed signals here... but their average ranking would be **6.5** &mdash; making them unlikely to be true rivals. I calculated  average recipricol rankings for each pair of owners and re-scaled the values to get a **"rival score"** between 0 and 100. Higher scores indicate that both you and the other owner ranked each other closer to 1st; lower scores indicate you both ranked each other close to 12th; scores in the middle could either mean you both gave middling ranks or that there was a big discrepancy in ranks given.

To make my life simpler, I assigned a rival score of **0** for every owner with himself &mdash; even for those people who ranked themselves first. I also replaced missing ranks with 12s.

If you've ever looked at a heatmap before, I've taken advantage of the convenient anagram and dubbed this graph the **"HateMap"**. Brighter colors mean MOAR RIVALNESS.

Some obvious matchups jump out here: **Tony-James** and **Keith-Kevin** both ended up with scores of 100, while **Ross-Billy** and **Brad-Drew** were pretty close. Still, relying on visual inspection of a bunch of numbers and colors to figure things out is for chumps. Let's try more science!

## Not a clusterf!#@, just clusters

Getting a little technical here, but the rival scores I calculated above are basically *"similarity"* measures, indicating how closely you and another owner align in terms of potential for rivalry. Taking the inverse of these similarity measures gives us pairwise *distances*, which is the input for some data clustering algorithms. In this case, I'll use a pretty simple technique called *hierarchical clustering* to automatically group owners.

Results of the cluster analysis are shown in the tree below. As you follow the tree from bottom to top, teams are succesively "linked" up based on their **rival score**. 

<img src="http://jaeddy.github.iofigure/source/2016-08-14-rivals-2016-edition/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Again, the more obvious matchups shake out pretty easily. However, now I can also get a better sense of what the "next best" set of rivalries might be. Whlie the **Shep-Toby** matchup is admittedly less strong and a little surprising, it turns out that they're the best fit for each other (especially because Keith is already taken...). Interestingly,  Matt and Milf are each grouped more closely to *pairs* of teams than they are to each other or any other individual team. This is likely because what might have been reasonably strong matchups for each of them (e.g., **Milf-Ross** or **Matt-Kevin**) weren't quite as strong as the top pairings. Matt and Milf's rival score is actually only **31.82**, which is kinda disappointing.



## OK, maybe a bit of a clusterf!#@...

Doing a quick check, I see that the average rival score for the 6 pairs above is **81.06**. Not terrible, but not awesome. (As an aside, hierarchical clustering algorithms are not designed to produce any sort of "globally optimal" groupings &mdash; but I'll save that discussion for anyone that's more curious). To see what the clustering looks like with a bit of tweaking, I downweighted any high, but not perfect rival scores: that is, for the **Brad-Drew** and **Ross-Billy** matchups, I adjusted scores from **~95** down to **90** and recomputed the clustering tree.

<img src="http://jaeddy.github.iofigure/source/2016-08-14-rivals-2016-edition/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

By loosening the "attraction" between Billy and Ross a bit, we end up with two new pairings: **Milf-Ross** and **Billy-Matt**; everything else stayed the same. With this setup, the minimum rival score is now **63.64** and the average is up to **90.15**. The dropoff in score for each of the new matchups is pretty minimal, and I think both could be entertaining. The **Shep-Toby** matchup is still a bit weak, but maybe it can be the start of something great?

## Networks &mdash; 'cause why not?

The graphic below doesn't really add any information, but I thought it'd be fun to make anyway. Quick key:

+ **bigger circle:** higher "rivaltude" score (like the first graph above)
+ **shorter connecting edge:** higher rival score (i.e., stronger rivals)
+ **thicker connecting edge:** higher rival score (i.e., stronger rivals)

Have some fun playing around with the diagram.

## Conclusions

Your 2016 rivalries, based on the data (and some minor adjustments) are as follows:

+ **Kevin-Keith**
+ **James-Tony**
+ **Brad-Drew**
+ **Billy-Matt**
+ **Milf-Ross**
+ **Shep-Toby**

Now I just need to figure out how to build a schedule around all of this. That might be an interesting topic for a follow-up post...

Also, this was a massive time sink that didn't help me prepare for the actual draft or season whatsoever. Crap.
