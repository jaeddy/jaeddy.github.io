Today I migrated my simple GitHub Pages content (pretty much just a bio and some links) to the [**beautiful-jekyll**](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) template. I'm hoping that the markdown-based layout and formatting will make it easier to throw up some interesting posts from time to time &mdash; and keep direct HTML editing to a minimum. In particular, I'm eager to see how easy it is to drop in analysis documents generated with [**R Markdown**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and maybe even some [**Plotly**](https://plot.ly/) graphics.

In the meantime, you can check out the links at the bottom to see what I'm up to on twitter, GitHub, etc.
